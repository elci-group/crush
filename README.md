scoop bucket add charm https://github.com/charmbracelet/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install crush
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Nix (NUR)</strong></summary>

Crush is available via the official Charm [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) in `nur.repos.charmbracelet.crush`, which is the most up-to-date way to get Crush in Nix.

You can also try out Crush via the NUR with `nix-shell`:

```bash
# Add the NUR channel.
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/main.tar.gz nur
nix-channel --update

# Get Crush in a Nix shell.
nix-shell -p '(import <nur> { pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {}; }).repos.charmbracelet.crush'
```

### NixOS & Home Manager Module Usage via NUR

Crush provides NixOS and Home Manager modules via NUR.
You can use these modules directly in your flake by importing them from NUR. Since it auto detects whether its a home manager or nixos context you can use the import the exact same way :)

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    nur.url = "github:nix-community/NUR";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nur, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.your-hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        nur.modules.nixos.default
        nur.repos.charmbracelet.modules.crush
        {
          programs.crush = {
            enable = true;
            settings = {
              providers = {
                openai = {
                  id = "openai";
                  name = "OpenAI";
                  base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1";
                  type = "openai";
                  api_key = "sk-fake123456789abcdef...";
                  models = [
                    {
                      id = "gpt-4";
                      name = "GPT-4";
                    }
                  ];
                };
              };
              lsp = {
                go = { command = "gopls"; enabled = true; };
                nix = { command = "nil"; enabled = true; };
              };
              options = {
                context_paths = [ "/etc/nixos/configuration.nix" ];
                tui = { compact_mode = true; };
                debug = false;
              };
            };
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to grab an API key for your preferred
provider such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter, or Vercel AI Gateway and just start
Crush. You'll be prompted to enter your API key.

That said, you can also set environment variables for preferred providers.

| Environment Variable        | Provider                                           |

| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`  | Azure OpenAI models                                |

### Subscriptions

If you prefer subscription-based usage, here are some plans that work well in
Crush:

- [Synthetic](https://synthetic.new/pricing)
- [GLM Coding Plan](https://z.ai/subscribe)
- [Kimi Code](https://www.kimi.com/membership/pricing)
- [MiniMax Coding Plan](https://platform.minimax.io/subscribe/coding-plan)

### By the Way

Is there a provider you’d like to see in Crush? Is there an existing model that needs an update?

Crush’s default model listing is managed in [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk), a community-supported, open source repository of Crush-compatible models, and you’re welcome to contribute.

<a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk"><img width="174" height="174" alt="Catwalk Badge" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95b49515-fe82-4409-b10d-5beb0873787d" /></a>

## Task Delegation

For complex coding tasks that span multiple modules or components, Crush can decompose the work and delegate it across different models running concurrently on isolated git branches with automatic conflict prevention.

### How It Works

Press `ctrl+d` to analyze a task for delegation suitability. Crush will:

1. **Analyze** the task for complexity and identify independent modules
2. **Propose** a delegation plan showing task breakdown and assigned models
3. **Review** the plan with confidence score, model assignments, and scope details
4. **Approve** the plan with optional modifications
5. **Execute** sub-tasks concurrently on isolated git branches with progress tracking
6. **Merge** results back to main with dependency-aware ordering and conflict resolution

### Workflow Examples

#### Example 1: Authentication Refactor
For a task like "refactor authentication system to support OAuth and add API rate limiting," Crush might propose:

```
Original Task: "Refactor authentication system to support OAuth and add API rate limiting"
Complexity: 8/10
Confidence: 92%

Proposed Sub-Tasks:
├─ Task 1: OAuth implementation
│  ├─ Assigned to: GPT-4 (OpenAI)
│  ├─ Branch: feature/oauth-1234567890
│  └─ Scope: internal/auth/oauth/**
├─ Task 2: Rate limiting middleware  
│  ├─ Assigned to: Claude 3.5 (Anthropic)
│  ├─ Branch: feature/ratelimit-1234567890
│  └─ Scope: internal/middleware/ratelimit/**
└─ Task 3: Integration tests
   ├─ Assigned to: GPT-4 (OpenAI)
   ├─ Branch: feature/auth-tests-1234567890
   └─ Scope: tests/auth/**
```

Each task runs independently with automatic file scope separation to prevent merge conflicts. Tasks complete in parallel and merge sequentially based on dependencies.

#### Example 2: API Enhancement
Task: "Add user profile endpoints with validation, caching, and documentation"

```
Sub-Tasks:
├─ API endpoints implementation
│  └─ Scope: internal/api/users/**
├─ Input validation layer
│  └─ Scope: internal/validation/**
├─ Redis caching integration
│  └─ Scope: internal/cache/**
└─ API documentation
   └─ Scope: docs/api/**
```

### Key Features

- **Intelligent Decomposition:** keyword-based complexity analysis (1-10 scale) and automatic module identification from task description
- **Multi-Model Assignment:** distribute tasks across different models and providers based on their strengths
- **Concurrent Execution:** sub-agents work in parallel on isolated git branches at true concurrency
- **Conflict Prevention:** scope-based file assignment with automatic overlap detection prevents merge conflicts
- **Dependency Awareness:** tasks can depend on each other; merge order respects these dependencies
- **Progress Tracking:** real-time monitoring with token usage, completion percentages, and step-by-step progress
- **User Approval:** review and optionally modify plans before execution
- **Auto-Merge Resolution:** multiple conflict resolution strategies (abort, manual review, or automatic with agent-decides mode)

### When to Use Delegation

Delegation works best for tasks with:
- **Multiple independent modules** (authentication, caching, validation, tests)
- **Clear separation of concerns** (API layer, middleware, persistence, UI)
- **Moderate to high complexity** (complexity score 6+)
- **No hard inter-task dependencies** (or clear ordering)

## Advanced Features (Kaptaind-Crush Specific)

### Context Injection with Snapshots (`ctrl+i`)

Intelligently inject project context with multi-resolution levels and token budgeting:

1. **Tree Summary** - Directory structure overview
2. **File Summaries** - List of selected files with sizes
3. **Full Content** - Complete file contents for selected files

Features:
- Snapshot-based file selection with checkbox tree UI
- Real-time token count estimation
- Automatic smart chunking when content exceeds context window
- Model-aware context window detection with auto-switching suggestions
- Per-file size limits and total token budgets

**Workflow:**
```
Press ctrl+i → Select files (tree view) → Set token budget → 
Preview compiled context → Inject into current task
```

### Smart Text Chunking

Automatically split large files into intelligent chunks for multi-window context:

- **Contextual Headers/Footers** - Each chunk includes its position ("Chunk X of Y")
- **Intelligent Boundaries** - Splits at logical paragraph/function boundaries, not just token counts
- **Line Overlap** - Maintains context continuity between chunks (configurable, default 10 lines)
- **Token Estimation** - Shows chunk size in tokens for better planning
- **Multi-Model Support** - Detects context window of selected model

When you attach a file (`ctrl+f`) larger than the model's context window, Crush automatically chunks it with visual indicators for easy reference.

### YouTube Mini Player (`ctrl+y`)

Integrated video playback for reference material while coding:

- **Audio-Only Mode** - Use `mpv` for lightweight playback (no video stream)
- **yt-dlp Integration** - Automatic YouTube URL resolution
- **Playback Controls** - Play/pause, seek, volume adjustment
- **Now Playing Display** - Current track, artist, duration, progress bar
- **Background Operation** - Watch while coding without interruption

**Controls:**
- `space` - Play/pause
- `←` / `→` - Seek ±10 seconds
- `↑` / `↓` - Volume ±5%
- `n` - Next track
- `q` - Close player

### Speech Features (`ctrl+u` for settings, `ctrl+r` for recording)

**Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
- Read code aloud for accessibility
- Multiple voice options and playback speeds
- Supports code comments, documentation, and full files

**Speech-to-Text (STT):**
- Record voice input with `ctrl+r`
- Automatic transcription to text
- Hands-free code dictation
- Useful for quick thoughts without typing

## Configuration

> [!TIP]
> Crush ships with a builtin `crush-config` skill for configuring itself. In
> many cases you can simply ask Crush to configure itself.

Crush runs great with no configuration. That said, if you do need or want to
customize Crush, configuration can be added either local to the project itself,
or globally, with the following priority:

1. `.crush.json`
2. `crush.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/crush/crush.json`

Configuration itself is stored as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "this-setting": { "this": "that" },
  "that-setting": ["ceci", "cela"]
}
```

As an additional note, Crush also stores ephemeral data, such as application
state, in one additional location:

```bash
# Unix
$HOME/.local/share/crush/crush.json

# Windows
%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\crush.json
```

> [!TIP]
> You can override the user and data config locations by setting:
>
> - `CRUSH_GLOBAL_CONFIG`
> - `CRUSH_GLOBAL_DATA`

### LSPs

Crush can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just
like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "lsp": {
    "go": {
      "command": "gopls",
      "env": {
        "GOTOOLCHAIN": "go1.24.5"
      }
    },
    "typescript": {
      "command": "typescript-language-server",
      "args": ["--stdio"]
    },
    "nix": {
      "command": "nil"
    }
  }
}
```

### MCPs

Crush also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through three
transport types: `stdio` for command-line servers, `http` for HTTP endpoints,
and `sse` for Server-Sent Events. Environment variable expansion is supported
using `$(echo $VAR)` syntax.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "mcp": {
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-server.js"],
      "timeout": 120,
      "disabled": false,
      "disabled_tools": ["some-tool-name"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "timeout": 120,
      "disabled": false,
      "disabled_tools": ["create_issue", "create_pull_request"],
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer $GH_PAT"
      }
    },
    "streaming-service": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp/sse",
      "timeout": 120,
      "disabled": false,
      "headers": {
        "API-Key": "$(echo $API_KEY)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ignoring Files

Crush respects `.gitignore` files by default, but you can also create a
`.crushignore` file to specify additional files and directories that Crush
should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that you want in version
control but don't want Crush to consider when providing context.

The `.crushignore` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore` and can be placed
in the root of your project or in subdirectories.

### Allowing Tools

By default, Crush will ask you for permission before running tool calls. If
you'd like, you can allow tools to be executed without prompting you for
permissions. Use this with care.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "permissions": {
    "allowed_tools": [
      "view",
      "ls",
      "grep",
      "edit",
      "mcp_context7_get-library-doc"
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also skip all permission prompts entirely by running Crush with the
`--yolo` flag. Be very, very careful with this feature.

### Disabling Built-In Tools

If you'd like to prevent Crush from using certain built-in tools entirely, you
can disable them via the `options.disabled_tools` list. Disabled tools are
completely hidden from the agent.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "disabled_tools": ["bash", "sourcegraph"]
  }
}
```

To disable tools from MCP servers, see the [MCP config section](#mcps).

### Disabling Skills

If you'd like to prevent Crush from using certain skills entirely, you can
disable them via the `options.disabled_skills` list. Disabled skills are hidden
from the agent, including builtin skills and skills discovered from disk.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "disabled_skills": ["crush-config"]
  }
}
```

### Agent Skills

Crush supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard for
extending agent capabilities with reusable skill packages. Skills are folders
containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that Crush can discover and
activate on demand.

The global paths we looks for skills are:

* `$CRUSH_SKILLS_DIR`
* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agents/skills` or `~/.config/agents/skills/`
* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/crush/skills` or `~/.config/crush/skills/`
* On Windows, we _also_ look at
  * `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agents\skills\` or `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\agents\skills\`
  * `%LOCALAPPDATA%\crush\skills\` or `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\crush\skills\`
* Additional paths configured via `options.skills_paths`

On top of that, we _also_ load skills in your project from the following
relative paths:

* `.agents/skills`
* `.crush/skills`
* `.claude/skills`
* `.cursor/skills`

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "skills_paths": [
      "~/.config/crush/skills", // Windows: "%LOCALAPPDATA%\\crush\\skills",
      "./project-skills",
    ],
  },
}
```

You can get started with example skills from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills):

```bash
# Unix
mkdir -p ~/.config/crush/skills
cd ~/.config/crush/skills
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/skills.git _temp
mv _temp/skills/* . && rm -rf _temp
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)

```

### Desktop notifications

Crush sends desktop notifications when a tool call requires permission and when
the agent finishes its turn. They're only sent when the terminal window isn't
focused _and_ your terminal supports reporting the focus state.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "disable_notifications": false, // default
  },
}
```

To disable desktop notifications, set `disable_notifications` to `true` in your
configuration. On macOS, notifications currently lack icons due to platform
limitations.

### Initialization

When you initialize a project, Crush analyzes your codebase and creates
a context file that helps it work more effectively in future sessions.
By default, this file is named `AGENTS.md`, but you can customize the
name and location with the `initialize_as` option:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "initialize_as": "AGENTS.md"
  }
}
```

This is useful if you prefer a different naming convention or want to
place the file in a specific directory (e.g., `CRUSH.md` or
`docs/LLMs.md`). Crush will fill the file with project-specific context
like build commands, code patterns, and conventions it discovered during
initialization.

### Attribution Settings

By default, Crush adds attribution information to Git commits and pull requests
it creates. You can customize this behavior with the `attribution` option:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "attribution": {
      "trailer_style": "co-authored-by",
      "generated_with": true
    }
  }
}
```

- `trailer_style`: Controls the attribution trailer added to commit messages
  (default: `assisted-by`)
  - `assisted-by`: Adds `Assisted-by: [Model Name] via Crush <crush@charm.land>`
    (includes the model name)
  - `co-authored-by`: Adds `Co-Authored-By: Crush <crush@charm.land>`
  - `none`: No attribution trailer
- `generated_with`: When true (default), adds `💘 Generated with Crush` line to
  commit messages and PR descriptions

### Custom Providers

Crush supports custom provider configurations for both OpenAI-compatible and
Anthropic-compatible APIs.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that we support two "types" for OpenAI. Make sure to choose the right one
> to ensure the best experience!
>
> - `openai` should be used when proxying or routing requests through OpenAI.
> - `openai-compat` should be used when using non-OpenAI providers that have OpenAI-compatible APIs.

#### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Here’s an example configuration for Deepseek, which uses an OpenAI-compatible
API. Don't forget to set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "providers": {
    "deepseek": {
      "type": "openai-compat",
      "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
      "api_key": "$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "deepseek-chat",
          "name": "Deepseek V3",
          "cost_per_1m_in": 0.27,
          "cost_per_1m_out": 1.1,
          "cost_per_1m_in_cached": 0.07,
          "cost_per_1m_out_cached": 1.1,
          "context_window": 64000,
          "default_max_tokens": 5000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Anthropic-Compatible APIs

Custom Anthropic-compatible providers follow this format:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "providers": {
    "custom-anthropic": {
      "type": "anthropic",
      "base_url": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1",
      "api_key": "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
      "extra_headers": {
        "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01"
      },
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
          "name": "Claude Sonnet 4",
          "cost_per_1m_in": 3,
          "cost_per_1m_out": 15,
          "cost_per_1m_in_cached": 3.75,
          "cost_per_1m_out_cached": 0.3,
          "context_window": 200000,
          "default_max_tokens": 50000,
          "can_reason": true,
          "supports_attachments": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Amazon Bedrock

Crush currently supports running Anthropic models through Bedrock, with caching disabled.

- A Bedrock provider will appear once you have AWS configured, i.e. `aws configure`
- Crush also expects the `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to be set
- To use a specific AWS profile set `AWS_PROFILE` in your environment, i.e. `AWS_PROFILE=myprofile crush`
- Alternatively to `aws configure`, you can also just set `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`

### Vertex AI Platform

Vertex AI will appear in the list of available providers when `VERTEXAI_PROJECT` and `VERTEXAI_LOCATION` are set. You will also need to be authenticated:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

To add specific models to the configuration, configure as such:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "providers": {
    "vertexai": {
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "claude-sonnet-4@20250514",
          "name": "VertexAI Sonnet 4",
          "cost_per_1m_in": 3,
          "cost_per_1m_out": 15,
          "cost_per_1m_in_cached": 3.75,
          "cost_per_1m_out_cached": 0.3,
          "context_window": 200000,
          "default_max_tokens": 50000,
          "can_reason": true,
          "supports_attachments": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Models

Local models can also be configured via OpenAI-compatible API. Here are two common examples:

#### Ollama

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "ollama": {
      "name": "Ollama",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1/",
      "type": "openai-compat",
      "models": [
        {
          "name": "Qwen 3 30B",
          "id": "qwen3:30b",
          "context_window": 256000,
          "default_max_tokens": 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### LM Studio

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "lmstudio": {
      "name": "LM Studio",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:1234/v1/",
      "type": "openai-compat",
      "models": [
        {
          "name": "Qwen 3 30B",
          "id": "qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-2507",
          "context_window": 256000,
          "default_max_tokens": 20000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Logging

Sometimes you need to look at logs. Luckily, Crush logs all sorts of
stuff. Logs are stored in `./.crush/logs/crush.log` relative to the project.

The CLI also contains some helper commands to make perusing recent logs easier:

```bash
# Print the last 1000 lines
crush logs

# Print the last 500 lines
crush logs --tail 500

# Follow logs in real time
crush logs --follow
```

Want more logging? Run `crush` with the `--debug` flag, or enable it in the
config:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "debug": true,
    "debug_lsp": true
  }
}
```

## Provider Auto-Updates

By default, Crush automatically checks for the latest and greatest list of
providers and models from [Catwalk](https://github.com/charmbracelet/catwalk),
the open source Crush provider database. This means that when new providers and
models are available, or when model metadata changes, Crush automatically
updates your local configuration.

### Disabling automatic provider updates

For those with restricted internet access, or those who prefer to work in
air-gapped environments, this might not be want you want, and this feature can
be disabled.

To disable automatic provider updates, set `disable_provider_auto_update` into
your `crush.json` config:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://charm.land/crush.json",
  "options": {
    "disable_provider_auto_update": true
  }
}
```

Or set the `CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE` environment variable:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_PROVIDER_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

### Manually updating providers

Manually updating providers is possible with the `crush update-providers`
command:

```bash
# Update providers remotely from Catwalk.
crush update-providers

# Update providers from a custom Catwalk base URL.
crush update-providers https://example.com/

# Update providers from a local file.
crush update-providers /path/to/local-providers.json

# Reset providers to the embedded version, embedded at crush at build time.
crush update-providers embedded

# For more info:
crush update-providers --help
```

## Metrics

Crush records pseudonymous usage metrics (tied to a device-specific hash),
which maintainers rely on to inform development and support priorities. The
metrics include solely usage metadata; prompts and responses are NEVER
collected.

Details on exactly what’s collected are in the source code ([here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/tree/main/internal/event)
and [here](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/blob/main/internal/llm/agent/event.go)).

You can opt out of metrics collection at any time by setting the environment
variable by setting the following in your environment:

```bash
export CRUSH_DISABLE_METRICS=1
```

Or by setting the following in your config:

```json
{
  "options": {
    "disable_metrics": true
  }
}
```

Crush also respects the `DO_NOT_TRACK` convention which can be enabled via
`export DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.

## Q&A

### Why is clipboard copy and paste not working?

Installing an extra tool might be needed on Unix-like environments.

| Environment         | Tool                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Windows             | Native support           |
| macOS               | Native support           |
| Linux/BSD + Wayland | `wl-copy` and `wl-paste` |
| Linux/BSD + X11     | `xclip` or `xsel`        |
